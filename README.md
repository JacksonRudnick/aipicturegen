# aipicturegen

This is just a quick project I put together to mess around with the chatgpt API

Its goal was to output a jpeg image that was outputed by chatgpt based on a prompt but everytime I tried to make the request OpenAI would say I have exceeded my max amount of requests.

I'll probably do a simplier version of this project in python in the future since OpenAI has a library built for it but this was a project made in my attempt to continue learning rust.
